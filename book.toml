# When there is more than one [output.*] section, the HTML will be generated under `<build-dir>/html/`.
# GitHub pages only renders content under `docs/`; see https://nathan-at-least.github.io/auto-deploy-howto.html
# So, we set build-dir to `build/` and have CI move `build/html/` to `docs/`. For convenience of local viewing,
# we also have a symlink from `docs` to `build/html/` (this is not sufficient for GitHub pages, so CI deletes
# the symlink and then does the move).
