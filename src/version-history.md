# Version History

## 0.1.0 - Introducing Crosslink

[Issue Tracking](https://github.com/Electric-Coin-Company/tfl-book/milestone/1?closed=1)

This version introduced the [Crosslink construction](./terminology.md#crosslink) by linking to an external write-up. It transitioned away from the implicit design presented at Zcon4 to a rigorously defined [hybrid construction](./terminology.md#definition-hybrid-construction).

## Prehistory - Zcon4 Presentation

Prior to the initial release of this book, a design sketch was presented in [Interactive Design of a Zcash Trailing Finality Layer (Hybrid PoW+PoS) by Nate Wilcox: Zcon4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhMzMYeEPMM&list=PL40dyJ0UYTLII7oQRQmNOFf0d2iKT35tL&index=19).
