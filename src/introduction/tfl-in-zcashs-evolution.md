# TFL in Zcash's Evolution

This Trailing Finality Layer (TFL) design provides a possible first step in transitioning [Zcash](https://z.cash) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.

## Zcash Background

From the [Learn Zcash](https://z.cash/learn/what-is-zcash/) site:

> Zcash is a digital currency — and a store of value — that keeps all your financial information private and in your control.

Zcash is powered by a decentralized blockchain, which is operated, maintained, and improved by a multitude of organizations and individuals. See [Funding & Governance](https://z.cash/network/?funding=#funding) for a high-level overview of the primary development organizations.

## How does TFL fit into Zcash Development

The TFL design is being developed by the [Electric Coin Co](https://electriccoin.co) as a proposal following our advocacy to transition Zcash to PoS. Our motivations are published in [Should Zcash switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake?](https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/)

For changes to the Zcash protocol to be deployed, a critical mass of users must adopt them. In addition multiple development organizations analyze, discuss, improve, and implement change proposals if they believe most users would want and benefit from them.

This proposal is early in this process, so it's not a given that it will be adopted or when. Our goal is to get early feedback on this incomplete proposal from the broad population of Zcash users as well as protocol development teams so that we're confident as it approaches maturity it has a good chance to be adopted.

Once this design is sufficiently mature and if we believe it has significant support, we will begin drafting one or more [Zcash Improvement Proposals](https://z.cash/network/?funding=#funding) to begin more focused coordination across the Zcash development community.
