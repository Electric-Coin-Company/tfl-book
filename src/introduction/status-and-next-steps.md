# Status and Next Steps

This is an early and incomplete protocol design proposal. It has not been well vetted for feasibility and safety. It has not had broad review from the Zcash community, so its status on any Zcash roadmap is undetermined.

## Current Components

### This Book

This book is intended to become both a high level overview and introduction to [TFL](../terminology.md#definition-tfl) as well as a full specification.

### Crosslink

The current heart of the design work is an in-progress hybrid consensus protocol construction called [Crosslink](../terminology.md#definition-crosslink). This is an in-development implementation of the [TFL](../terminology.md#definition-tfl) design goals. The essential design details are specified, along with a security argument of its [liveness](../terminology.md#definition-liveness). The security argument for its [safety](../terminology.md#definition-liveness) is in progress.

The draft specification and security arguments of Crosslink currently live on [this hackmd](https://hackmd.io/JqENg--qSmyqRt_RqY7Whw?view).

### `simtfl`

We've begun creating a simulator called [`simtfl`](../terminology.md#definition-tfl) which we will use to model security and abstract performance concerns. Its development is tracked at <https://github.com/zcash/simtfl>.

## Major Missing Components

- PoS subprotocol selection,
- Issuance and supply mechanics, such as how much ZEC stakers may earn,
- Integrated Zcash transaction semantics,
- A transition plan from current Zcash mainnet to this protocol design,
- [ZIP](../terminology.md#definition-tfl)s specifying the above to the level of specificity required by ZIPs,
- Security and safety analyses,
- Economic analyses

This list may be incomplete and as the design matures the need for major new components may be revealed.

## Next Steps

This design proposal is being developed by [ElecticCoin Co](https://electriccoin.co/) as the first major milestone in our focus of deploying Proof-of-Stake to the Zcash protocol. Our rough near term plan for this proposal is as follows:

1. Complete [Crosslink](../terminology.md#definition-crosslink) protocol specification.
2. Complete core security arguments for [Crosslink](../terminology.md#definition-crosslink).
3. Define the [Major Missing Components](#major-missing-components) above, including considerations such as issuance mechanics and Proof-of-Stake mechanisms.
4. Complete auxillary security arguments and analyses, such as specific attack scenarios, game-theoretic security, and so forth.
5. Mature [`simtfl`](../terminology.md#definition-tfl) to analyze all cases of interest.
6. Follow the general Zcash process for proposal/review/refinement, including proposing  or more [ZIP](../terminology.md#definition-tfl)s.
7. Follow the general Zcash governance process for proposal acceptance.
8. If accepted, productionize the proposal in ECC products and collaborate with other implementors who implement the proposal.
9. Celebrate when the proposal is activated on Mainnet. ðŸŽ‰

The fine-grained day-to-day goals and tasks for this project are present in [the Zcash Developers Hub](https://zcash.github.io/developers) in the [TFL-focused DAG](https://zcash.github.io/developers/zcash-tfl-dag).
