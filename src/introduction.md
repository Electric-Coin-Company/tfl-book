# A Trailing Finality Layer for Zcash

This book introduces and specifies a *Trailing Finality Layer* for the Zcash network.

This design augments the existing Zcash Proof-of-Work (PoW) network with a new consensus layer which provides *trailing finality*. This layer enables blocks produced via PoW to become *final* which ensures they may never be rolled back. This enables benefits for wallets and other infrastructure as well as protocol improvements.
